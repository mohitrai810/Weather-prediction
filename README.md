# Weather-prediction

The given code is a Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application for displaying weather and time information. Here's a description of the code:

1. The code starts by importing the required modules: `tkinter`, `requests`, `datetime`, `pytz`, and `messagebox`.

2. It creates an instance of the Tkinter `Tk` class and sets the title of the GUI window to "Weather by Mohit".

3. Two labels are created to prompt the user for input: one for entering the city name to retrieve weather information and another for entering the city name to retrieve the current time.

4. Two entry fields (`Entry` widgets) are created to allow the user to input the city names.

5. Two functions, `press()` and `click()`, are defined to handle button clicks.

   - The `press()` function is called when a button is clicked to retrieve weather information. It retrieves the city name entered by the user, constructs a URL using the OpenWeatherMap API, and sends a request to fetch weather data. The response is displayed using the `messagebox` module.

   - The `click()` function is called when a button is clicked to retrieve the current time. It retrieves the city name entered by the user, uses the `pytz` library to get the timezone corresponding to the city, and fetches the current time using `datetime`. The current time is then displayed using the `messagebox` module.

6. The `tt()` function is defined but not used in the given code. It prints a list of available timezones, but it's not invoked anywhere in the code.

7. The code binds the functions `press()` and `click()` to button clicks.

8. Finally, the Tkinter event loop is started to handle user interactions and display the GUI.

Overall, this code creates a simple GUI application that allows users to retrieve weather information and current time for a specified city.
